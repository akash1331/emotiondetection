# Facial_Emotion_Detection_with_raspberry_pi

Facial Emotion Recognition using Open-CV
This project recognizes facial emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise in real time.
It includes seven classes which are mentioned above.
This is created using a Deep Learning Model and trained it using different samples of Images and used the trained model to predict the emotions.

To run the project:
-- Just run the python file "detection.py"
-- Running the ipynb notebook is not recommended as the trained model is already saved as "model.h5"
-- Note that-> "face_emotion_model.h5" file contains weights of the neural network
