# Facial Emotion Detection with RaspberryPi<br/>
<br/>
Facial Emotion Recognition using Open-CV <br/>
This project recognizes facial emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise in real time.<br/>
It includes seven classes which are mentioned above.<br/>
This is created using a Deep Learning Model and trained the model using different samples of Images to predict the emotions.<br/>
<br/>
To run the project:<br/>
-- Just run the python file "detection.py"<br/>
-- Running the ipynb notebook is not recommended as the trained model is already saved as "model.h5"<br/>
-- Note that-> "face_emotion_model.h5" file contains weights of the neural network.<br/>
